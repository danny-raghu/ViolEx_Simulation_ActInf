# ViolEx_Simulation_ActInf
Formalizing ViolEx using Active Inference

## Abstract
Expectations play a critical role in human perception, cognition, and decision-making. There has been a recent surge in modelling such expectations and the resulting behaviour when they are violated. One recent psychological proposal is the ViolEx model. To move the model forward, we identified three areas of concern and addressed two in this study - Lack of formalization and implementation. Specifically, we provide the first implementation of ViolEx using the Active Inference formalism (ActInf) and successfully simulate all expectation violation coping strategies modelled in ViolEx. Furthermore, through this inter-disciplinary exchange, we identify a novel connection between AIF and Piaget’s psychology, which engenders a convergence argument for improvement in the former’s structure/schema learning. Thus, we see this as the first step in developing a formal research framework to study expectation violations and hope to serve as a base for future ViolEx studies while yielding reciprocal insights into ActInf.
